Model-Oriented Programming - Umple.org

Umple is a modeling tool and programming language family to enable what we call Model-Oriented Programming. It adds abstractions such as Associations, Attributes and State Machines derived from UML to object-oriented programming languages such as Java, C++, PHP and Ruby. Umple can also be used to create UML class and state diagrams textually.

Umple is an open source project, so details will evolve. However, it is ready to be used for real systems. In fact the Umple compiler itself is written in Umple. Any Java, C++ or PHP project could use Umple. We have found the resulting code to be more readable and have many fewer lines. This is because Umple means you can avoid having to code a lot of 'boilerplate' code that would be needed to implement associations and attributes, a system based on Umple should also be less bug-prone.
